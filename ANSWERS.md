### Technical Questions

* How long did you spend on this code test? What would you improve if you had more time?

* ANSWER: I spent about 12 hours on the test, in non-contiguous chunks.  If I had more time I would add more tests, and perhaps use a more full-fledged framework, depending on future requirements.  I am fairly new to Flask, and I chose it to build my knowledge, but I can see how there could easily be a need for a more feature-rich framework to build upon this API.

* How would you change or improve our data if you could?

* ANSWER: The data seems pretty clean.  I'm not sure if it is complete, or if there are some metrics data that could be added.  I generally try to keep streamed metric data like this in its pristine form, unaltered, so if that's being done then it seems ok to me.

* Why did you choose the language, framework, and libraries that you did?

* ANSWER: I really wanted to see if Flask could fit the bill: a small, simple implementation that is easily readable and testable.  Sometimes I feel it's better to sketch out an idea with simple tool that will inform you where the actual needs are in terms of adding scaffolding and feature sets, vs jumping into a more complicated framework immediately.

* How enjoyable was this challenge? Do you have any feedback?

* ANSER: This was an enjoyable challenge, I think the instructions were clear and I learned from it.  It also has an aspect of practicality to it.
